A few heuristics came up as very important.  One was the ability to get clear feedback of the status of an email.  It should be obvious whether the email has been read, replied to, forwarded, or had any other operation performed on it.  It should be immediately apparent what this status is so a user can quickly scan through emails without having to explicitly focus on any single one.  Another interesting heuristic brought up by Dwight was having some sort of sorting and filtering on emails.  It should be easy to determine how important an email is and a general understanding of its contents.  A user should be able to see that there is an "important" advertisement as opposed to an important email from a family member.

Initially, I made the mistake of conflating evaluation heuristics and features.  This is partially because I'm familiar with email inboxes.  I expect an inbox to have a search bar.  I expect that search bar to be somewhere near the top of the page.  However, choosing to list the presence of a search bar as a heuristic limits potential design solutions.  Search is used to fulfill the need of a user to quickly find a specific email.  It's possible that there is another solution to that problem that does not involve search.  We had joked about having a tree of emails where going each level down represents a different aspect of the email itself.  Even though that idea is horrible, there is still a  chance that there is a good solution that we haven't thought of.

Also, I don't have anything grand to write about this, but one of the heuristics listed in the powerpoint is that "common tasks should be easy; rare tasks should be possible".  That's just a really good way of putting it and I want to try to incorporate that into future designs.
