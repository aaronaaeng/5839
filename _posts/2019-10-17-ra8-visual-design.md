### Organization and VIsual Structure
My favorite part of this reading was the section on common errors in visual design.  It prompted me to look for interfaces that suffered from the problems laid out.  Specifically, I want to talk about excessive display density in the context of settings pages.

I find myself overwhelmed by settings pages more often than any other interface I use.  Even when I know exactly what I am looking for, it is still hard for me to find it.  I've noticed that there are two main strategies to address this problem: grouping like settings and adding search functionality.

Grouping the settings works really well for game keybindings.  There usually aren't a ton of settings for inputs and they can easily be grouped into categories like movement of combat.  Where grouping starts to fall short is when there are so many settings that groups and sub-groups have to be introduced.

I get lost in iOS settings all the time.  I don't know why.  Whenever my phone tells me I should run a backup, I spend a solid 10 minutes looking for the button to press.  That is because iOS has so many settings that they had to resort to sub-groups upon sub-groups.  The higher that menu tree becomes, the more likely it is that setting will be an unexpected place for a user.  To address this, Apple added search functionality to settings.  That should be helpful except the search never is useful which just makes it more frustrating.  Go type "backup" into the settings search on an iPhone and see how bad the results are.

This all made me reconsider one of the sketches I did for the study buddy app.  The screen that had users enter their schedules/classes was a complete mess.  There were options everywhere that were placed with very little care and it made the screen look crowded and overwhelming.


### Arranging elements
The grid system reminded me of the material design guidelines.  Material design has a series of guidelines on how to use [cards](https://material.io/components/cards/) to convey information.  By providing a consistent structure, it makes it easier for users to understand how the system works.  It also ensures they're familiar with how they should interact with the system.  Going back to my study buddy app, I didn't have a consistent structure.  A grid system would've allowed me to make information more easily accessible to users.

I went looking around in the material design docs and found that they even have an entire section on how to use [grids](https://material.io/design/layout/responsive-layout-grid.html).  A lot of their language is reminiscent of the reading.


### Preattentive Processing
This section was about using differences in appearance to make things "pop out" to users making them easier to see.  When I first started reading, I immediately thought of the iOS messages app.  Every UI element is greyscale except for your messages and the send button.  This immediately creates an association between pressing that button and messages being sent.  This is a simple way of conveying a relationship between a button and its action which can help to remedy a gulf of execution.
