For this week's reading, I read *Research Contributions in Human-Computer Interaction*, *Interaction in 4-Second Bursts*, and *Cultural Probes*.  I selected the mobile interaction one because it sounded cool.  I selected the final article because I couldn't even guess what it was about.  The first paper was about the different types of contributions that can be made to HCI research.  This provided a good framework to understand the other two papers.

For example, *Interaction in 4-Second Bursts* makes clear empirical contributions.  However, it also makes interesting methodological and theoretical contributions as well.  I really liked reading this as it made me think about our project idea.  We are currently looking to do a wrist-based device that can provide information without you needing to actively engage with it.  This paper provides clear data surrounding how active use of a mobile device detracts from other functions.  It can serve as a good foundation as we continue to explore our project idea.

*Cultural Probes* was a little more abstract.  The first thing about this article that stood out to me was that it seemed to open in media res.  I had to reread the first section a few times before I fully understood what was going on.  What I find funny about that is how that definitely falls in line with the general methodology of the paper.  When I was reading it, I just wanted it to be a "normally" structured research paper.  However, the whole point of the article was to show the benefit of approaching research from a different perspective.  I wanted it to be different but I was wrong.  This is a super cool article that shows how a different approach to research methodology can improve participant interaction and create novel responses.

# General reading notes if you're into that sort of thing

## Research Contributions in Human-Computer Interaction
Empirical Contributions
- Research based on data and observations
- Evaluated on significance and methodology

Artifact Contributions
- Prototypes to show new techniques/solutions
- Sometimes accompanied by empirical studies

Methodological Contributions
- New approaches to conducting research
Theoretical Contributions
- Improved concepts/frameworks
- Validate through empirical work

Dataset Contributions
- New data corpus for further study
Survey Contributions
- Meta-analyses

Opinion Contributions
- Persuasive essays
- Though called "opinions", they're rooted in data
- Basically a paper showing someone's interpretation


## Interaction in 4-Second Bursts
Mobile devices take away focus from other actions
- People often have to put themselves in less taxing situations in order to focus
- Interacting with a mobile device competes with the same resources to navigate an environment
Think of human action as a series of interactions
- Need to contextualize self in an environment

### Research Competition Framework
In mobility, person must constantly switch between different inputs to understand environment

Four resource assumptions
- Functional modularity
    - Cognitive systems are in subsystems
- Parallel module operation
    - Subsystems can parallelize
- Limited capacity
    - Cognitive modules are limited in capacity with respect to time or perception
- Serial central operation
    - Coordination of modules is serial

Five competition assumptions
- Multitasking
- Resource pooling
- Task differences
    - Some tasks require more resources
- Preferenctial resource sharing
- Resource-depletion penalty
    - Tasks lacking resources are slowed or terminated

Multitasking interference
- Structural
    - Multiple tasks compete for peripheral resources
- Capacity

Conducted a study tasking participants with using a mobile device while travelling through different environments

Found that there was a significant effect of situation on the duration of continuous attention
Also found a significant difference in how often a participant looked away.

## Cultural Probes
Provided a box of "cultural probes" to people from diverse communities in hopes that it would increase interaction

Postcards
- With questions on back
- Informal

Maps
- Asked questions about where people had been/would like to go
- Asked them to mark various things on the map

Camera
- Requested images of specific items or just whatever the person wanted

Photo Album
- Tell a story in pictures
- Record media intake

Approach tech research like designers instead of scientists

Waited for responses
Didn't publish a holistic review of it.  Instead used it as a basis for proposals
- It was basically a system of performing interviews but done in a much more free-form manner
