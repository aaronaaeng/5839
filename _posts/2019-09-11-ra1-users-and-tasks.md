## This video is about 20 years old! Which ideas from this work show up in today's shopping carts? Which ideas did not make it, and why didn't they?

Recently, many major grocery stores have rolled out scanners to be used while shopping.  It is a direct implementation of the idea shown in the video.  One of the main goals of the design was to reduce theft.  Ideo recognized that the value in a conventional shopping cart is based in its large basket.  By removing the basket entirely, and replacing it with small segmented sections, that incentive for theft is eliminated.  This is reminiscent of current cart designs that use two baskets arranged vertically.  Though these baskets are not removeable, it still solves the problem in the same way.

One idea that is not currently being used is the way in which children were strapped into the cart.  Ideo opted for a cart handle that lifted to double as a way to secure children to the seat.  This likely isn't being used today because that's a far more cumbersome process than just using a seatbelt.

Velcro pants also aren't a thing yet.

## Who did the design team talk to? For each group of stakeholders that the designers talked to, explain why it was important to talk to them.

The team identified three groups they wanted to speak to: cart manufacturers, store owners, and shoppers.  It was important to talk to them because they all have a different perspective on the issue.  Store owners discussed problems like theft and how quickly carts can move when blown by the wind in a parking lot.  They also expressed a need for the carts to be stored easily.  Meanwhile, shoppers with small children expressed concerns surrounding child safety.  Though store owners had safety concerns of their own, talking with parents about what specifically worries them provided more context for better designs.  The final design of the cart explicitly had space for children to use as a play surface attached to the cart.  That's the type of design decision that is entirely rooted in user group feedback.
