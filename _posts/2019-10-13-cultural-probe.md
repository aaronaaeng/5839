For our cultural probe, we wanted to see how a potential user would interact with our solution as well as get a good idea of just how often people have reactions to aeroallergens.  This meant that we needed a wrist-based approach to tracking the number of reactions that occur.

The first approach was to have a participant wear something on their wrist and somehow directly tally when a new reaction takes place.  We had discussed methods from carrying around a notebook and marking in it to even putting stickers on a wrist band.  Unfortunately, all approaches like this have the same problem; it requires conscious effort from the participants.  We needed to ensure that our probe didn't inconvenience our participant too greatly.  To remedy this, Dwight came up with a solution.

Instead of having participants count incidents in an additive manner, we needed them to do it in a subtractive manner.  This means they won't have to reach for special supplies just to record an event.  Therefore, Dwight suggested having a stack of sticky tabs on a wrist-band.  When experiencing a reaction, participants are asked to pull a tab.  In the end, we'll simply have to count how many are remaining to determine the number of reactions.
