This was my first time really sketching out a UI for something so I kept it fairly simple.  I was unsure how specific of a location was needed to be shared so my first design was fairly specific.  It was basically just the pin-dropping method used by most navigation software.  The second design made things slightly less specific in a similar fashion to Craigslist.  Instead of a specific location, an entire zone is specified with the guarantee that the user is somewhere within the radius.  This got me thinking of a more freeform method.  If the goal is to use this data to meetup, we could have a user draw an area of where they're willing to meet up.  This gives more control for a user to find areas they'd like to avoid.  My final sketch is basically just the same as the first method but instead of a pin, it asks a user to enter an address.
