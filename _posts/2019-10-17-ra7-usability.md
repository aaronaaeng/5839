Recently I noticed that the school was locking the engineering center on the weekends.  Now this was news to me as they hadn't done this in the four years I've already been here.  Nevertheless, I knew that I needed to get into the building and that it was locked.  This presented me with my first gulf of execution as, when looking at the door, there was no clear way to unlock it.  However, I could follow some pipes to a card reader a few steps behind me.  This presented me with another gulf of execution.  I didn't know which direction my card should face but I made my best guess based on the look of the system.  After I swiped my card, I encountered a gulf of evaluation.  There was no way to tell whether my card opened the door, failed to open it because I lacked access, or failed to open it because there was a problem with my card.

In the end, I gave up on trying to get my card to work because I though I lacked access.  Instead, I just didn't know which way my card should be facing.  There were a few heuristics that were not met:

#### Visibility of system status
There is a panel with different colored lights that could provide status.  However all three lights were just blinking repeatedly no matter what action I had just taken.  There was no way to tell what the status was.

#### Error Prevention
There was no clear indication of the proper card orientation.

#### Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
There was no clear indication of what the error was.  This caused me to assume the incorrect result and give up on trying to enter the building.
