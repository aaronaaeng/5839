There were a few things that stood out from these readings.  The first was the P x C rule.  This rule states that you should give greater detail on something if the chances of a mistake times the cost of a mistake crosses a threshold.  Though not a revolutionary idea, it's an interesting way to quantify the need to add specificity.

The whole reading about personas was interesting.  I often am the generic engineer that was chided in the reading.  I always throw around the idea of a user that wants what I want to make and will accommodate any poor decision that I make.  However, I need to forego the elastic user in favor of a specific persona.  This persona needs a specific name and backstory that informs the design.  I also need to be sure to design for just the one persona as designing for too many will cause me to create a bad design that doesn't work well for anyone.

I also drew out a task model for one of my homework assignments from last week:

0. Finish 5253 lab 3
    1. Pull the starter repo
    2. Read the description
    3. Figure out solution
        - 3.1 Sketch out solution
        - 3.2 Go to office hours
        - 3.3 Ask a friend
    4. Implement solution
        - 4.1 Read Hadoop documentation
        - 4.2 Implement map
        - 4.3 Implement reduce
        - 4.4 Complain about hadoop/python
    5. Submit assignment
​

Plan 1: do 1-2-3-4-5 in order
​

Plan 3: do 3.1.  if needed, do 3.2 or 3.3 until 3.1 is complete
​

Plan 4: do 4.2 and 4.3 until solution complete.  do 4.1 if needed.  do 4.4 often
