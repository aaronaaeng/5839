I had a fever for 5 days so I missed the actual lecture for this.  However, here are my personas for Google Cardboard:

#### Cori
Cori is a recent computer science graduate that loves the idea of using technology as art.  She has wanted to get into VR for years but lacks the space needed for a full-size VR setup.

#### Erik
Erik is a school bus driver.  He is familiar with technology but doesn't have a technological background.  He is curious about VR but is afraid of purchasing something very expensive as he gets motion sick very easily.  He needs to try out VR a lot before he can commit to something better.

#### Ethan
Ethan is a college student that is really into tech trends.  He already has a full-size VR setup but is curious about getting something smaller.
