This storyboard focuses on the most basic situation for the system.  The project is made up of a wristband and companion app.  The wristband has basic information because, in an emergency, there isn't a need for a ton of details.  Simple feedback is all that is needed.  Once removing themself from a situation, a user can then check the fully-detailed report in the app.  There were only two situations in which I needed to use arrows.  This was to convey movement between two rooms.  Otherwise, the only remotely interesting part of the sketch is the shading in the roof of the room.  I needed a way to convey that a room was contaminated without explicitly writing it.  I feel as though this does a good enough job.  Each frame is annotated to describe what is happening.  It should be high enough resolution to view it.  If not, just open the image in a new tab.
