![Sticky note prototype]({{ "https://aaronaaeng.github.io/5839/assets/stick-sketch.jpg" }}){: .center-image }

The first prototype that I made was the first time I had ever made a paper prototype for an app.  Because of this, I  made a few choices that I won't make again.  It really came down to unfamiliarity with drawing a screen on sticky notes.  That sounds weird because they're literally just squares but that's the problem.  I'm so accustomed to screens that are not squares that I kept running out of space to actually put everything that I wanted to include.  To fix this I tried to stick two of them together but then all of my screens were different sizes.

Separate from my inability to comprehend squares, I also just had difficulty drawing the UI.  I found it very difficult to represent something that could be navigated.  When I tasked a user with selecting a day on the calendar, I didn't know what to draw next.  I was unsure whether to draw just one individual section of the calendar or a bunch of them so the user could swipe to navigate different areas.  This taught me my first major lesson of prototyping: replicate as much functionality as is needed but don't try to get everything perfect.  It's okay if the prototype doesn't support a nonessential action if that action would be extremely difficult to implement.

On the second round of prototyping, I decided to use uniformly sized pieces of paper.  Because these had no adhesive on them, it also made sliding them around very easy.  This let my prototype fake more functionality.  I'm actually pretty happy with how my prototype turned out.  It's simple but it gets the job done.  Making it taught me my second lesson in prototyping: steal things.  The top bar that shows the name of the current screen and the back bar is ripped directly from iOS.  The bottom bar was stolen directly from the design of the person next to me.  There's no point in reimplementing something that already works.
