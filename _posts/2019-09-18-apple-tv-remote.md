I missed this class because I joined late.  However, I ran it again with my family when I was home sick.

### Formative Questions
What is the problem?
Is it a hardware problem or can it be fixed in software?
Are there current alternatives?
What have users done to fix it themselves?

### Initial ideas
Make it an asymmetric shape
Clearly change the color of each side
Design a remote such that it doesnt completely break everything if you pick it up upside-down

### Design sharing
An interesting consideration that I didn't think of was changing the weight while preserving the shape.  The remote will naturally fall to have the heavier side down so you.  We thought of other small remotes that we had and wondered whether we had that issue.  The Roku remote has a big red button at the top of it and a little tab that says "Roku" on it on the bottom.  I have always thought this was a weird choice but those two features give a clear way for someone to orient the device.

The final idea is to add a unique color to the top and a unique physical feature to the bottom.  This gives a user two potential points to determine the orientation of the remote before picking it up.  The red button at the top of the remote is also a fairly common design on remotes so it can pull on a user's prior knowledge to make usage easier.
