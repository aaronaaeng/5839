I actually left early during this class because I had to run to talk to Rajshree to ensure I could graduate on time.  That being said, I interviewed a friend of mine.  When asked about an activity she does, she said that she was a DM for a D&D campaign.  Because I am familiar with the activity, I tried to avoid asking questions about what that work entailed and tried to instead ask about how she felt about doing it.  I asked what she found the most difficult and she said that it was when the party got off track.  She didn't feel too confident in her ability to improvise and was worried she was trying too hard to force the party into a pre-determined path.  This prompted me to ask how much time was spent preparing the campaigns and she said that it varied between 5-15 hours per week.  I asked whether there were any aspects of D&D that she didn't like and she said that she and her party preferred the story aspects of the game to the combat.  That is why they switched to instead do Monster of the Week over just 5E.

This generally went well though I found myself unsure what to ask.  Because I didn't really plan out the interview beforehand, I didn't have any goals in the discussion other than "gaining information".  But that was vague enough to not be helpful.
