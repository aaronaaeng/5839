Our project has no software-defined visual interfaces.  This means that prototyping this functionality is new to me.  A lot of the strategies make sense for building paper renditions of user interfaces but our interface is entirely haptic.  This leaves us with 2 prototyping options.

The first is a mock-up.  It'll be important for us to determine whether the wrist-based solution will be a good one.  We can create a mockup of the wristband and ask potential users to wear it.  In fact, this is similar to what we are doing in our cultural probe.  We are having participants wear a wristband that has sticky tabs on it.  Whenever they have a reaction we ask them to pull a tab.  This will let us get a real-world trial of our system without having to actuall build it out.

Another option is a Wizard of Oz approach.  This can get more complicated if we want but it doesn't need to be.  We can create a simulated situation in which a participant receives feedback that there is an aeroallergen nearby.  Then we can see how they react.  It's possible that we could actually create a small prototype that just receives and command and gives the haptic feedback but this likely would be overkill.  We could also just tell the participant that a simple action we are taking is a stand-in for the feedback.  This would still let us get a sense of the device's usefulness.
